# A comprehensive guide for building a modern website

This guide is put together to serve as an in depth consultation for business owners and enthusiasts who are initiating a web development project. And also a guide for developers to keep up with the evolution of technologies and processes. 

This guide is created based on three high-level questions that every must ask themselves before starting a web project. 
* [What is the goal?](#a-what-is-the-goal)
* [What are the requirements?](#b-what-is-the-requirement)
* What is the Return on Investment(ROI)?

### **A. What is the goal?**
Small or big, write down the goal that you want to reach with the website idea. It is very much possible to deviate from the initial goal and end up at a totally new goal as you progress. It is ok to add a few bells and whistles here and there during the development, but that should not become an overhead and drag the project down. 

Some example goals:
* Reach more audience with your content
* Increase revenue on goods or services
* Establish a presence
* Get more customers to your shop

Put the goal on a leash. It is the primary driver for the entire lifecycle of the site. You can have multiple goals on a single website, but there has to be a primary.

### **B. What are the requirements?**
When asessing the requirements, consider the following three areas.
* [Technology](#b1technolgy)
* People
* Processes

#### **B.1.Technolgy**
There are several technologies to choose from for your project. It can be as simple as a combination of HTML/CSS/JS or an advanced framework/CMS that includes a full suite of tools to build. A modern website should be
1. [Accessible](#b11-accessible)
2. [Intuitive](#b12-intuitive)
3. [Responsive](#b13-responsive)
4. [Scalable](#b14-scalable)
5. [Productive](#b15-productive)
6. [Secured](#b16-secured)
7. Extensible
8. Available
9. Measurable

#### **B.1.1 Accessible**
A website is considered accessible when it can serve every user equally including users with auditory, cognitive, visual disabilities. 

An accessible website performs well with small screen devices, slow internet connection, bright sunlight on screen etc., Refer to [W3.org](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#what) for more details about accessibility. While accessibility is important in all scenarios, it is the most important technology requirement to consider when building a site for content publishing for readers such as news, blogs and video publishing platforms.

#### **B.1.2 Intuitive**
A website is considered intuitive when users do not need to spend plenty of time trying to find what they are looking for. 

It can get overwhelming to the users when the site is disorganized. To avoid this situation
* Organize your content
* Place your CTA (Call to Actions) in relevant locations
* Simplify navigation
* Provide search filters

These are small decisions, but collectively they can have a huge impact on overall user experience.

#### **B.1.3 Responsive**
A website is considered responsive when the content fits well on all screen sizes. 

It can be a smartphone or a large monitor, your website should display content without truncating in smaller screens or stretching in larger screens. Responsiveness has taken a high priority due to the shift in the usage of devices. More and more users tend to use smartphones than desktops to access a website. Build according to your user base.

#### **B.1.4 Scalable**
A website is considered scalable when it has the ability to handle a large number of users concurrently. 

Select a technology that has the potential to scale according to the demand of the users. You can get started small initially, but if the technology cannot be scaled to grow along with your growing business needs, it is a huge downside. 

There are many modern technologies such as 
* Serverless app
* Headless CMS
* Kubernetes 
 
that can facilitate scaling your site based on demand. Make sure to talk to your developers about this technology requirement. Scalability may not apply to all business needs, but if it applies to your goal, make sure to explore this requirement. 

#### **B.1.5 Productive**
A website is considered productive when the maintainence is streamlined. 

If basic duties such as updating, organizing and improving site becomes a hassle, it can cost you time and money. Quick changes should not have to go through a technolgy pipeline. Content managers should have the freedom and felxibiltiy to produce content, submit for review and get changes approved on the fly. This requirement can also vary based on team sizes. If you have a small team, automate as much as you can to eliminate unnecessary bureaucratic processes to deliver product while still maintaining proper protocols in place. 

#### **B.1.6 Secured**
A website is considered secured when the information stored and used during transactions cannot be tampered with or stolen. 

The minimum criteria to make sure that the website is secured is, when you can assure that the privacy, confidentiality and integrity of the data is not breached.
