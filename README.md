# A comprehensive guide for building a modern website

This guide is put together to serve as an in-depth consultation for business owners and enthusiasts who are initiating a web development project. And also a guide for developers to keep up with the evolution of technologies and processes. 

This guide is created based on three high-level questions that everyone must ask themselves before starting a web project. 
* [What is the goal?](#a-what-is-the-goal)
* [What are the requirements?](#b-what-are-the-requirements)
* What is the Return on Investment(ROI)?

### **A. What is the goal?**
Small or big, write down the goal that you want to reach with the website idea. It is very much possible to deviate from the initial goal and end up at a new goal as you progress. It is ok to add a few bells and whistles here and there during the development, but that should not become an overhead and drag the project down. 

Some example goals:
* Reach more audience with your content
* Sell goods or services
* Build a brand reputation
* Get more customers to your shop

Put the goal on a leash. It is the primary driver for the entire lifecycle of the site. You can have multiple goals on a single website, but there has to be a primary.

### **B. What are the requirements?**
When assessing the requirements, consider the following three areas.
* [Technology](#b1-technolgy)
* People
* Processes

#### **B.1 Technolgy**
There are several technologies to choose from for your project. It can be as simple as a combination of HTML/CSS/JS or an advanced framework/CMS that includes a full suite of tools to build. A modern website should be
1. [Accessible](#b11-accessible)
2. [Intuitive](#b12-intuitive)
3. [Responsive](#b13-responsive)
4. [Scalable](#b14-scalable)
5. [Productive](#b15-productive)
6. [Secured](#b16-secured)
7. [Extensible](#b17-extensible)
8. [Available](#b18-available)
9. [Measurable](#b19-measurable)

#### **B.1.1 Accessible**
A website is considered accessible when it can serve every user equally including users with auditory, cognitive, visual disabilities. 

An accessible website performs well with small screen devices, slow internet connection, bright sunlight on screen, etc., Refer to [W3.org](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#what) for more details about accessibility. While accessibility is important in all scenarios, it is the most important technology requirement to consider when building a site for content publishing for readers such as news, blogs, and video publishing platforms.

#### **B.1.2 Intuitive**
A website is considered intuitive when users do not need to spend plenty of time trying to find what they are looking for. 

It can get overwhelming to the users when the site is disorganized. To avoid this situation
* Organize your content
* Place your CTA (Call to Actions) in relevant locations
* Simplify navigation
* Provide search filters

These are small decisions, but collectively they can have a huge impact on the overall user experience.

#### **B.1.3 Responsive**
A website is considered responsive when the content fits well on all screen sizes. 

It can be a smartphone or a large monitor, your website should display content without truncating in smaller screens or stretching in larger screens. Responsiveness has taken a high priority due to the shift in the usage of devices. More and more users tend to use smartphones than desktops to access a website. Build according to your user base.

#### **B.1.4 Scalable**
A website is considered scalable when it can handle a large number of users concurrently. 

Select a technology that has the potential to scale according to the demand of the users. You can get started small initially, but if the technology cannot be scaled to grow along with your growing business needs, it is a huge downside. 

There are many modern technologies such as 
* Serverless app
* Headless CMS
* Kubernetes 
 
that can facilitate scaling your site based on demand. Make sure to talk to your developers about this technology requirement. Scalability may not apply to all business needs, but if it applies to your goal, make sure to explore this requirement. 

#### **B.1.5 Productive**
A website is considered productive when the maintenance is streamlined. 

If day-to-day duties such as updating, organizing, and improving the site become a hassle, it can cost you time and money. Quick changes should not have to go through a technology pipeline. Content managers should have the freedom and flexibility to produce content, submit for review and get changes approved on the fly. This requirement can also vary based on team sizes. If you have a small team, automate as much as you can to eliminate unnecessary manual review processes to deliver fresh content while still maintaining proper protocols in place. 

#### **B.1.6 Secured**
A website is considered secured when the information stored and used during transactions cannot be tampered with or stolen. 

When your website is placed on the internet the chances of threats will begin to increase along with its reputation. The higher the site traffic the higher the threats you may receive. 

The minimum criteria to make sure that the website is secured is when you can assure that the privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of the data are not breached. 

This is a very important technology requirement. Assess the vulnerabilities of the technology that you are choosing. Evaluate the complete technology stack such as Server OS, Storage, Network rules, Firewall rules, etc, and Web server configurations. Anyone unaddressed vulnerability can potentially cause outages which can hurt revenue.

Implement measures to identify and prevent threats before they reach the site. 

#### **B.1.7 Extensible**
A website is considered extensible when the data can be exchanged with third-party service providers. 

Almost all categories of websites provide one way or another to integrate with third-party services such as authentication using social media accounts, consuming REST APIs to display social feeds. Extensibility is an important technology recommendation to consider if your users would like to choose services from other websites via your website. 

The ability to extend your website using REST API endpoints will make your website future-proof. This will also make sure that your website does not become a data silo over time and become complex to retrieve data for business reports or other purposes. 
#### **B.1.8 Available**
A website is considered available when it can be reached at all times from all means. 

Availability directly impacts the experience of the end-user. There are many possible ways an outage can occur. A highly available website has redundant architecture. Simply called HA architecture. Implement HA at all technology levels. Some HA recommendations are below

* Redundant databases (primary, secondary)
* Load balanced web servers
* Implementing caching layers
* Distributed file storage
* Hosting and Sync with multiple data centers

With the above architecture in place, you can still achieve 99% uptime of your website even during an outage of one or more services. 

#### **B.1.9 Measurable**
A website is considered measurable when its metrics can be logged and used for improvements.

Log as many metrics as possible such as load times, response times, page not found errors, redirect loops, form submissions, referral website of the users etc and so on. Without logging information you cannot identify room for improvements using data. Data driven decisions will steer you towards your goals quicker than your own intuition. 

Setup Key Performance Indicators (KPI) on certain aspects of your website which are critical for your business as well as website itself. Deriving timely insights will propell you in the right direction saving you additional costs in marketing and increase engagement rate of your users.
